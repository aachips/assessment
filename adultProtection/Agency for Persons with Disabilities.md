In October 2004, the Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) became an agency separate from the Department of Children and Families, specifically tasked with serving the needs of Floridians with developmental disabilities. Prior to that time, it existed as the Developmental Disabilities Program. The agency is governed by [Chapter 20](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0000-0099/0020/Sections/0020.197.html "External Website"), [Chapter 393](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0393/0393.html "External Website"), and [Chapter 916](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0900-0999/0916/0916ContentsIndex.html&StatuteYear=2012&Title=-%3E2012-%3EChapter%20916 "External Website") of the Florida Statutes.

APD works with local organizations and private providers to support people who have developmental disabilities and their families in living, learning, and working in their communities. APD identifies the service needs of people with developmental disabilities, and those individuals may receive social, medical, behavioral, residential, and/or therapeutic services.
