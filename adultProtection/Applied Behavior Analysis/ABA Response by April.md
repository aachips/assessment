ABA is a touchy subject. There is controversy about the ethics of ABA. It's by a very loud vocal minority, but their grounds are far from baseless, and many of these people went through ABA as a kid. ABA has evolved a large amount since it's conception, but it's still the same fundamental philosophy and practice. 

The core of what ABA practices is, neurodivergent kids and adults have different behaviors from normies. They have different types of needs. And for parents who don't understand the nuances, these behaviors and needs can be really confusing to understand. When kids have unmet needs, they act out, throw tantrums, have meltdowns, scream, or behave erratically because that is how they know how to communicate. 

Let's say your kid screams and screeches all the time and it absolutely wrecks home life and causes problems with neighbors. You may not have the time energy and resources to understand this behavior in the longer term, and may need to hire an expert to work with your ND kid to fix their behavior. The problem is, the behavior is there for a reason, and if you focus on the surface behavior, and not the underlying needs, it can become really abusive. 

What a lot of ABA will teach kids is how to perform a skill called Masking. Masking is the common term used to describe hiding neurodivergent traits so that you appear more normal. In the short term, this can be helpful. But in the long run, it really messes kids up psychologically that when they become adults, they either are a fake persona, they are a deeply troubled unregulated mess. Because there are not many adult services out compared to services for kids, ND adults can fall through cracks, become homeless, destitute, chronically unemployed, live undignified lives, and die early  preventable deaths.

If you are going into ABA for kids, a safe rule to go by, is that you are helping kids and their parents find ways to regulate, be healthy, and safe in their autistic expressions. The types of behaviors many associate with autism, are behaviors that come up when we aren't cared for properly. 

Here's an example. I can't stand prolonged loud noise. If I am around loud live music for a couple hours, it disturbs my body and mental regulation. I need to rest, recharge, and be alone for a day after that to be okay. If I am constantly around noise like that, I will go absolutely bonkers. If I don't get alone recharge time, and someone is pestering me when I am unregulated, I will yell at them to go away. When I am not pushed beyond my limits, or neglecting recharge time, I am a quiet, productive, and pleasant person. 

The time of the year that this becomes a big problem for me is around the fourth of July. I live in a red southern state in the US in an area where a lot of people do backyard fireworks. Firework displays 35 feet from my house type of thing. I have a dog who is terrified of gunshots. My rental unit is not very soundproofed. People here will start around July 1st with their fireworks. For about a week, I am a complete wreck. I try to barricade my room window with egg cartons, have fans going, grey noise machines, music playing, you name it. It blocks out about 65% of the sound. The remaining 35% is still there and extremely stressful. My dog will be having a panic attack and I don't have the internal capacity to comfort them, so I get more annoyed and scared. 

In the weeks after the fireworks stop, I am hypersensitive to sound. I hear the electric noise from appliances and it's really annoying. My adrenaline is depleted and I have a hangover from that. I generally have to sleep a lot and am a wreck if I need to do something. I can get brain fog and forget things like turning off the sink or the stove burner. or leaving a house door open. It's not a great time for me to drive then, but if I have to, it's roads I know well at low traffic hours. If I get stuck in traffic when its hot, or get lost on back roads, it can turn into a dangerous situation. If I got into a car wreck, it may be determined that I am not competent to drive. The reality is, I'm a mess because of the damn fireworks, and am completely competent the rest of the time. 

So let's say a ND kid is like this, and their family lives in a loud neighborhood where there are gunshots regularly. That child is having meltdowns (not same as tantrum). Some ABA therapists will try to solve this at a surface level instead of helping the child cope and manage. Something really popular is noise canceling headphones for situations like this. Sometimes always having a television on making noise is a nice distraction. Sometimes having calming aromatherapy in the room like a diffuser is helpful.

Sensory sensitivities are really common among the population you are working with. Kids may smell the chemical fragrances of items way more than you do and become physically ill. They may freak out to certain feelings of textiles on clothes or in their environment. They may not like the same games and activities as other kids, or even being around other kids at all. 

They might thrive being alone and in quiet, or need to always have sensory inputs even. ADHD is very interconnected to Autism. This is an oversimplification, but what I observe is that Autistic people are generally overstimulated by every day life, and ADHD people are understimulated by every day life. 

The problem method is assuming that an autistic child needs to change themselves to fit in the world. The solution method is observing and knowing their behavior is completely natural, and that it is the world that is causing issues to the autist.
