Illest Mental 

If I’m in a place where I am scared for my safety and wellbeing, should I run and escape with my own two feet?


I want to do a panic anxiety survey project on Google survey.

Name(Anonymous or no?)

Age___

Preferred Pronoun:

He.Him.His/She.Her.Hers/Other(non-binary)/Other(questioning/unsure)

  

Warning: This survey will be asking personal questions about the nature of your panic anxiety. If talking about panic attacks or anxiety is a trigger, please handle this survey with caution.

  

The nature of this survey is very difficult for many people to confide and talk about. These are very difficult themes. You are not obliged by taking this survey to finish or to complete every question. A sentence from you is helpful and so is a full length novel.

  

If answering in text is not a great expressive medium for you, please feel free to send whatever is, whether it be music, a picture, a piece of art, spoken word, or something else.

  

Describe an attack you've gone through of your choice.

Describe to the best of your abilities the trigger which caused that attack.

Describe to the best of your abilities the nature of what triggered your attack. Can it be traced to a specific event? Can it be traced to a specific way you felt? Can it be traced to something you care deeply and lovingly about? Or something you feel injustice about?

How long have you had panic anxiety?

How frequent were your attacks?

Do these attacks still occur? Do they still play a valuable role in your life?

What do you find is best for you in the midst of an attack?

What would a space that was safe for you to be in while panicking be like?

Can I use your answers in an online exhibit to others experiencing panic anxiety? (If you would like to be anonymous check the box by name)

  
  

I’m posting this because people I care about and would like to retain in my life are clueless interacting with anxiety, panic, and meltdowns. 

  

Panic anxiety is an psychiatric epidemic in the modern world. Give some statistics. The most common causes of death are automobile accidents and heart disease. Hmm, anxiety fit in their much??

  

I had to leave at 3 am in a state of overload and sheer terror from a lady friend’s apartment I’ve been staying at. I was having a meltdown and they were screaming at me, trying to lock me into a room, when all I wanted to do was leave.

  

This is a universal sign for: Stop talking, I need quiet, and space. It is common with autists and meltdowns. One characteristic of autism is sensory sensitivities and overstimulation.

  

I have ear damage from loud music and live shows. I have battle trauma,I had a childhood tutor who routinely crossed boundaries with my parents, pseudo stalked me, and treated me like I was broken in every way. For various reasons, when I am stressed out, overnoised, and frustrated, I can have meltdowns where every single voice feels like a razorblade scraping against my ears. When this happens, I don’t retain any of that information, it just feels like I am being assaulted. It’s painful and excruciating, and as much as I hate ever telling someone to shut up, what I need in that moment  is for you to STOP TALKING!

  

If you have somebody in your life that suffers from anxiety attacks. They do not need your diagnosis, evaluation, or fixing. Maybe they need some tea, maybe they need a hug. Maybe they need you to back the fuck off. Maybe they need someoen to talk to who will listen openly and not get defensive. You can ask that person what they need in that moment, or during future attacks.

  

An experience I’ve had and an experience other people afflicted with anxiety have reported is that hospitals, psychiatric units, and law enforcement are TERRIBLE at responding to anxiety.Mental illness is a hugerisk factor for police brutality. 

  

I don’t even like seeing panic as a mental disorder. Having panic anxiety is a tragic expression of a soul on fire.Maybe it’s a call to action, maybe it’s the past haunting you. Maybe you are in a dangerous situation, whether on an interpersonal level or existential. My panic attacks from 2010 to 2011 ceased when I realized I would rather drop dead than be an innocent bystander. That started years of activist work in my life.

  

Now that panic is resrfacingBack then I feared I was going to die. I was onsetting in chronic adulthood asthma. During the cold seasons I would feel like my heart was going to explode and that air wasn’t getting to my head. Freaking out was an expression of my desire to live.

  

I’m at peace with my mortality, but I am terrified of what the modern world is doing to us and the planet. I’ve engaged for free with work in that realm so that I could sleep at night. My life is fragmented and broken andfor my own survival I really need to get my shit together.I’ve resisted employment asa form of solidarity and grief expression. 

  

Anxiety is not a weakness. Do the work anxiety is calling you to do and you may discover your hidden superpowers or life’s purpose.

  

This is only if you survive through it. Reach out to your friends and loved ones tha need a hand of support. You could very well save a life.

  

I am not a medical or psychiatric professional. Do not take what I say as medical advice. Howeverhaving survived the experience lends some credibility to support others with lessons I learned the hard way. Take it witha grain of salt.

  

If I tell you you hurt me in some fashion by means of something you did. It’s not up to you to argue and debate the validity. Stop being defensive and exercise some humility. I’m being vulnerable addressing this with you

  

When I am in a reactive state of fear, blood is not going to my head. It’s going to my hands to fight, and to my feet to run.

  

Abusive relationships are built upon trying to fix or change the other person. If you don’t accept someone for who they are, leave them be.**
