d. erotomanic type 

I like the premise of this question much more than some of the others. In this instance, I think it would be appropriate to diagnose a troubling set of behaviors and have that be reflected on a file report. This is why. 

Believing that a celebrity that has never met 34M, somehow requites being in love with 34M, is a risk factor for sexual violence. 34M may believe a pretty stranger that shows him basic kindness wants to be with him and enact stalking like behavior, and not taking no for answers. It is a risk factor of being more likely to cause serious harm onto someone. 

34M going to a social worker, recognizing they have a problem is a window of opportunity to help prevent violence from happening.  It is also helpful if he does go on to hurt someone and that person files for a restraining order, it will have been documented in a file report that they showed higher risk factor and had self-reported erotomanic delusions. This will help them to be held legally accountable for their actions. 

_____________
I don't like these questions. All of them are generally about how to diagnose individuals. I chased Social Work credentials to help people. More often diagnoses are used to take someones rights and autonomy away. I don't care what the protocol in the field is, I don't think BSWs, MSWs, or anyone without Medical training should be diagnosing. Can describe behaviors without diagnosing. In nonviolent communication it's the principle of Observation > Evaluation.

The answer out of the four is A, but my priority would be asking questions to understand what eating clay and inedible materials does for them, and come up with strategies of how they can keep themselves safe in that habit. They may need to talk to a doctor to see if the items they fixate on eating are safe in those amounts. From personal experience, craving chewing on ice can be a symptom of low blood iron. That isn't medical advice, but I might include that on a write up to share with their PCP to get their blood work done.
    
 Also, ingesting clay in small amounts may involve missing cross-cultural context. Whatever populations and demographics you work with, cultural competency is really important.

    Feedback: you say anyone without medical training, however psychological disorders fall under psychology and social work not as much medical. The medical is used for the treatment but medical personal such as a regular doctor wouldn’t always be trained in diagnosing. Plus you can only diagnose officially with an msw and sometimes only with a lcsw
