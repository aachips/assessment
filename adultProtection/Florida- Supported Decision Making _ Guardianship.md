NRC-SDM State Grantee Program:

-   Summary: The Florida Supporting Choices Project, created by the North Florida Office of Public Guardian, has been working towards a two-fold objective. First, the project will establish a small support group made up of individuals with disabilities and older adults who have identified personal goals in areas where they wish to achieve greater decision-making independence.  Second, the project will revise the existing “Florida Developmental Disabilities Council’s Developing Abilities: As Workbook for Persons with Disabilities” to remove any state-specific references.

-   **Supported Decision-Making Pilot Project  
    **Disability Rights Florida (DRF) is hosting an Equal Justice Works Fellow, sponsored by the Florida Bar Foundation. The fellowship project, which runs from September 2019 to September 2021, aims to protect and restore the civil rights of people with disabilities in Miami-Dade County by expanding Supported Decision-Making (SDM) as an alternative to guardianship. The project includes: (1) free legal services for people in Miami-Dade County who either want to avoid a guardianship or terminate one; (2) education efforts, including local presentations in Miami-Dade County and developing legal information materials for statewide dissemination; and (3) legislative education on the importance of passing an SDM law in Florida.  
    While the legal services component of the pilot project is limited to Miami Dade County, DRF hopes to expand its Supported Decision-Making legal services to include helping individuals with disabilities across the state once the pilot project is completed. If you live in Miami-Dade County and are interested in learning more about using Supportive Decision-Making, please call 1-800-342-0832. If you would like information on the project or to collaborate with us contact our fellow Viviana Bonilla López at 850-617-9788 or [vivianabl@disabilityrightsflorida.org](mailto:vivianabl@disabilityrightsflorida.org).

    The study sought to increase awareness of the legal process of restoration through: (1) developing a website and accompanying manuals tailored to persons under guardianship and their families, self-advocates, guardians, the legal community and other interested parties; (2) advocating for the improved collection of data on guardianship and persons with developmental disabilities by the courts and state agencies; and (3) Conducting workshops designed for persons under guardianship and their families, self-advocates, guardians, and the legal community.
