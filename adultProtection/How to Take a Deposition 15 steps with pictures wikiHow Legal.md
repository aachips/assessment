Depositions are interviews of a witness or party to a case conducted by the other party or that party's attorney. Depending on the issues involved in the case, depositions can be a key part of the discovery process and can potentially turn a case around. Taking a deposition requires a significant amount of research and preparation, with extraordinary attention and patience during the interview itself. While you probably won't take a great deposition until you've had a lot of practice, even your first deposition can be useful and effective if you prepare thoroughly and keep the creation of a written record in mind.[[1]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-1)

Part1

Developing Your Strategy

1.  [
    
    ![Image titled Take a Deposition Step 1](https://www.wikihow.legal/images/thumb/0/0b/Take-a-Deposition-Step-1.jpg/aid7748522-v4-728px-Take-a-Deposition-Step-1.jpg.webp)

    1
    
    **Determine your purpose.** Before you go into a deposition, you need to have a good sense of why you want to depose this particular individual and what you hope to get out of the interview. Determining your purpose helps you focus your initial preparation.[[2]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-2) [[3]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-3)
    
    -   Review all documents and information you already have regarding the case, and make sure you know the facts and details of the case well – especially the elements you must prove to win your case. You also should understand any claims or defenses raised by the other side.
    -   If the case is likely to go to trial, your deposition transcript potentially will be used to impeach the witness's testimony on the stand by pointing out situations in which their testimony changed.
    -   For example, if the witness states in the deposition that they couldn't see the car accident clearly, you could bring this up if suddenly at the trial the witness states that they could see the accident and you were obviously at fault.
    -   A deposition typically will be longer and broader in scope if you anticipate the case going to trial. In contrast, if it's more likely the case will be settled, the purpose of your deposition may be more narrow, aimed solely at whatever information is most likely to affect the settlement value of the case.
    -   Take note of general topics you will need to address in the deposition based on the purpose for which you're taking it. These general topics will become sections in the outline you will write and use to organize your questioning.

    ](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#/Image:Take-a-Deposition-Step-2.jpg)
    
    2
    
    **Create a general outline.** As part of your preparation, a general outline can help you make sure that you stay on track and get the information you need during the interview itself. At the same time, you don't want your interview to be too specific and detailed or it can be a handicap.[[4]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-4) [[5]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-5)
    
    -   Your outline should be a general list of topics you need to cover – not a script. Ideally, the deposition transcript will read like a conversation that flowed organically, but a conversation cannot take place if you are wedded to a specific list of questions.
    -   Writing down and asking very specific, detailed questions also runs the risk of alienating the witness, especially if you ask something that the witness believes they've already answered.
    -   Create your outline as a tool to focus your questioning and make sure you get the information you need, not as a crutch that prevents you from being engaged in the interview with the witness.

    ![Image titled Take a Deposition Step 3](https://www.wikihow.legal/images/thumb/f/f9/Take-a-Deposition-Step-3.jpg/aid7748522-v4-728px-Take-a-Deposition-Step-3.jpg.webp)
    
    ](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#/Image:Take-a-Deposition-Step-3.jpg)
    
    3
    
    **Frame your style of questioning.** Based on your research of the case and the witness's role in your case, you can get a general idea of how you'll ask your questions and the tone you'll take in the interview itself.[[6]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-6) [[7]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-7)
    
    -   Your question style depends on the witness's role in the proceedings. If you're interviewing the other party, or a witness for the other side, the deposition may very well become antagonistic.
    -   However, if you're interviewing one of your own witnesses, or someone whose testimony could go either way, such as an eye-witness to the incident at the heart of the lawsuit, you want your tone to be more collegial and friendly.
    -   Your style of questioning also will be determined by the purpose of the deposition. If the witness won't be available at trial, direct and narrow questions will focus the witness's answers, since the deposition will be the only time that witness's testimony will be on the record.
    -   In that situation, you'll want to ask more controlling questions than open-ended questions, because you don't want the witness to say something that might damage your case at trial.
    -   On the other hand, if the witness will be available at trial, you want your questions to be as open-ended as possible, so the witness can talk and tell their story.
    -   If they're a witness for the other side, you'll have the opportunity to cross-examine them at trial, and anything they said in the deposition can be useful if it contradicts their trial testimony.

    ](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#/Image:Take-a-Deposition-Step-4.jpg)
    
    4
    
    **Prepare for possible objections.** While there are only two legitimate objections opposing counsel can make during a deposition, you should go through your outline and note areas in which you're likely to encounter opposition so you can respond accordingly.[[8]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-8) [[9]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-9)
    
    -   If the witness is represented by an attorney, that attorney may try to instruct their client not to answer a question based on some legal objection, assuming that you won't know or understand the objections available.
    -   In a deposition, the attorney may only object as to the form of the question, or on the basis of privilege, if the answer involves information protected by attorney-client privilege.
    -   Generally, you want to avoid questions that could be challenged on the basis of privilege. However, if the attorney objects to the form of your question, the witness still has to answer the question.
    -   If you assert yourself early on in the deposition, the attorney will be less likely to continue to make the deposition difficult – but you have to understand the objections that can legitimately be made and not give the attorney any leeway to argue anything else.

Conducting Your Interview

1.  [
    
    ![Image titled Take a Deposition Step 5](https://www.wikihow.legal/images/thumb/0/04/Take-a-Deposition-Step-5.jpg/aid7748522-v4-728px-Take-a-Deposition-Step-5.jpg.webp)
    
    ](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#/Image:Take-a-Deposition-Step-5.jpg)
    
    1
    
    **Have the witness sworn in.** Before the deposition can take place, the witness must be sworn in by the court reporter who will be recording the interview and producing the transcript of the deposition later on.[[10]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-10) [[11]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-11)
    
    -   If you requested the deposition, you must arrange for the court reporter.
    -   Typically it will be sufficient for you simply to say to the court reporter "swear them in." Try to avoid making too much of a point about the formalities or drawing too much attention to the court reporter, as this can be intimidating for the witness, particularly if they've never been deposed.
    -   If the witness is represented by an attorney, that attorney will have explained the deposition process to them. If they are a witness for the other side, the other party's attorney likely also will have explained the process to them.
    -   It's in your best interests to keep any explanation of the formalities of the deposition process to a minimum, to avoid intimidating the witness, which could cause them to clam up.
    
2.  [
    
    ![Image titled Take a Deposition Step 6](https://www.wikihow.legal/images/thumb/4/45/Take-a-Deposition-Step-6.jpg/aid7748522-v4-728px-Take-a-Deposition-Step-6.jpg.webp)
    
    ](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#/Image:Take-a-Deposition-Step-6.jpg)
    
    2
    
    **Ask about attorney representation.** Even if you already know, you want to ask the witness on the record if they are represented by an attorney and whether that attorney is present. This can be especially important if you are deposing a third-party witness who is represented by the opposing party's attorney.[[12]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-12)
    
    -   A third-party witness represented by the opposing party's attorney should signal to you that this witness could possibly have played a larger role in the incident that gave rise to the litigation, and may even be complicit in the actions alleged.
    -   Keep in mind that the attorney would not agree to represent the witness if there was any potential conflict of interest between that witness's situation and that of the original party to the case.
    -   Try to do this through direct questions rather than making statements such as "let the record reflect the witness is represented by the attorney."
    -   You want to make as few references to the written record as possible so the witness won't be repeatedly reminded that their statements are being recorded.
    
3.  [
    
    ![Image titled Take a Deposition Step 7](https://www.wikihow.legal/images/thumb/2/24/Take-a-Deposition-Step-7.jpg/aid7748522-v4-728px-Take-a-Deposition-Step-7.jpg.webp)
    
    ](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#/Image:Take-a-Deposition-Step-7.jpg)
    
    3
    
    **Find out the witness's previous experience.** Begin the deposition by asking background questions that will establish – both for your knowledge and for the record – whether the witness has previously been deposed or involved in other civil litigation.[[13]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-13) [[14]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-14)
    
    -   Pay attention to the witness's answers and feel free to allow them to discuss their previous experiences, even if they have little bearing on the case at hand.
    -   Allowing them to talk, and to feel that they can speak freely, sets the precedent that they can speak openly and that you are someone they can trust.
    -   Ascertaining their previous experience also can help you adjust your tone and the language you use in subsequent questions.
    -   If the witness is fairly sophisticated and has been deposed several times – for example, if they are a doctor who frequently testifies regarding a plaintiff's injuries, or a human resources staff member who frequently testifies regarding their company's employment policies – you need not worry about explaining basic concepts.
    -   At the same time, a sophisticated witness may be more difficult to get information out of. If you let a witness talk, they may "slip up" and say something they probably wouldn't have if they'd had a moment to think about it. However, the more experienced a witness is, the less likely they'll be to lose control of what they're saying.

    ![Image titled Take a Deposition Step 8](https://www.wikihow.legal/images/thumb/0/05/Take-a-Deposition-Step-8.jpg/aid7748522-v4-728px-Take-a-Deposition-Step-8.jpg.webp)
    
    ](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#/Image:Take-a-Deposition-Step-8.jpg)
    
    4
    
    **Establish the witness's role in the case.** Your early questions should focus on who the witness is, why they're being deposed, and what their role is in the dispute or transaction that gave rise to the litigation.[[15]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-15) [[16]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-16)
    
    -   Think about your reasons for taking the deposition. The purpose of the deposition, at least in terms of this particular witness's importance to the dispute or transaction at the heart of the litigation, should be established early on.
    -   If the person you're deposing was an eye witness to the incident that gave rise to the lawsuit, ask them questions about where they were and what they saw, as well as questions regarding their relationship to you or to the other party.
    -   If you are suing a company and the person you're deposing is an employee of that company, ask them questions about their job including how long they've worked for the company and what their job entails.
    -   If a written job description is available and you've already acquired a copy of that document through a request for production, you should have it with you at the deposition so you can ask questions directly related to that official job description and determine the ways in which what they do for the company in practice may deviate from that official job description.
    
5. **Encourage the witness to elaborate.** As you continue the deposition, ask open-ended questions that will get the witness talking – and keep them talking. When they stop, ask them what happened next and encourage them to keep talking.
    -   Think about how you would interact with someone in a casual conversation, such as if a friend or co-worker was telling a story. If the witness stops talking, focus on something they've said that might have importance and get them to expand on it by asking them something directly related to that.
    -   For example, if the witness says that they work in human resources and one of their job responsibilities is handling the paperwork for employees who have been discharged from the company, you might focus on that and ask them "You said you handled paperwork for discharged employees. What documents does that entail?"
    -   You also might want to find out how much paperwork is involved, approximately how long it takes the witness to process an employee discharge, and the kinds of issues that typically are raised.
    -   Generally, you must be inquisitive about every statement the witness makes. Don't take anything at face value.
    -   Think about how a small child often asks "why?" after every statement, and approach what the witness says in a similar fashion. Keep asking until you're sure you have the information you need, but don't ask so much that you're badgering the witness or annoying them. Your pushes for elaboration on a point should be likely to reveal information that has relevance to the lawsuit.
    
6.  **Don't forget to listen.** It can be easy to become overly focused on your outline and the questions you need to ask that you're paying more attention to what your next question will be than how the witness has responded to what you've just asked.[[19]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-19)
    
    -   This is an area where having an extremely detailed outline with questions written out to be read verbatim can be a liability. If you're too focused on checking questions off your list, you typically will pay less attention to how the witness is answering the question you've asked.
    -   Think about conversations you've had in which the person seemed more interested in getting out whatever point they wanted to make rather than listening to what you had to say.
    -   Seeming to have an agenda can turn off the witness, particularly if you're rehashing material the witness believes they've already covered.
    -   To this end, you also want to avoid taking detailed notes while the witness is speaking. Not only can this make the witness nervous or suspicious about what you're writing down, but it means your mental focus is more on your notes than it is on what the defendant has to say.
    -   You will have a transcript of the proceedings that you can look over at your leisure. During the deposition, being an active and engaged listener can result in getting the witness to open up in a way that never would have been possible if you treat the experience like an assignment where you must ensure specific questions are asked.
    

### Creating Your Record
1.   **Focus on simple, straightforward questions.** Complex, multi-part questions can confuse the witness and may result in an inaccurate answer that doesn't reflect the intention of your question. Appearing in print in the transcript, a long question also can cause confusion when read back.[[20]]
    -   Keep in mind that if the question is confusing, the answer won't be as valuable as if the question is straightforward and has a clear meaning and intent.
    -   Even a question that seems to make sense when you say it may not make sense in print – particularly if it draws on a contextual reference that you don't mention.
    -   Try to open your questions with a specific reference to something the witness said that prompted the question. For example, you might say "You mentioned taxes earlier. Can you expand on your role in reporting taxes for your employer?"
    -   Avoid conditional questions, which may not be entirely answered and leave questions in the record. If you have a conditional question, ask the first part (typically a yes/no question), and then follow-up with the second part depending on the witness's answer.
    -   For example, if the litigation concerns a car accident and you are questioning the defendant's doctor, you might ask "Did you treat the defendant?" and then when the witness says they did, you can follow up with questions about the treatment.
    -   This creates a cleaner record than asking "Did you treat the defendant, and if so, what sort of treatment did you provide?"
    
    2    **Avoid interrupting the witness.** The primary goal of a deposition is to get testimony from the witness – even if they get off track or seem to have misunderstood your question. Interruptions make it difficult to understand what's going on when reading the transcript.
    
    -   You also should avoid implying that the witness's answer was wrong. People don't like being told they're wrong, and you don't know how defensive the witness might get if they perceive they are being judged or attacked for their answers.
    -   If the witness misunderstood your question or is going off on a tangent, listen patiently to their answer, and then redirect to get the information you want.
    -   For example, you might say "I understand that you were distracted by your child and looked away from the scene, but before that happened, did you have an unobstructed view of the incident as it was taking place?" Based on the witness's answer to that question, you're free to ask for more detail on what the witness actually saw.
    -   Typically, you'll get a much better – and more useful – response than if you interrupt the witness and say "No, I'm not asking about whether you were distracted, I'm asking whether there was anything blocking your view."
    -   Interrupting the witness also can create a confusing transcript where it is unclear who is speaking or what the original question was. This can result in unanswered questions that cause you to miss key information you otherwise could have gotten out of the witness.
    -   If the witness gets off track and forgets what you've asked, repeat the question yourself in simple terms rather than asking the court reporter to read the question back. This keeps the conversation between the two of you and avoids drawing unnecessary to the court reporter.
    
3.  3 **Establish the foundation for documents.** Visual cues are lost in a text transcript, so it's important to describe any documents referenced thoroughly so they can be identified within the text of the transcript.[[23]]
    
    -   For example, if you're interviewing an employee of the company you're suing and you want to ask them questions from an official job description, you should first state the title of the document you're using, when that document was written, and how you acquired the document.
    -   Then ask the witness if they've ever seen the document and assess their degree of familiarity with it. You also may want to find out the context within which the witness was exposed to the document and whether it was referenced more than once.
    
4. **Maintain control.** Since you're taking the deposition, the transcript is your record, so you need to make sure it's going to accurately reflect the interview and give you concrete, usable information. Throughout the deposition, keep the text transcript in the back of your mind so you can act quickly to correct anything that may not translate into the text-only environment.
    -   If the witness is represented by an attorney and the attorney wants to consult with them before they've answered your question, make sure this information is noted on the record. However, avoid doing this in a formal way such as saying "Let the record reflect that the witness consulted with her attorney before answering the last question."
    -   Instead, say something like "Now that you've had the opportunity to discuss this with your attorney, can you explain to me what your role is in the discharge of employees?"
    -   Avoid making jokes on the record. A joke can lighten the mood and put the witness at ease, but often the humor doesn't translate into the cold, written record.
    -   This doesn't mean you can't make jokes or use levity – just let the court reporter know in an unobtrusive way that your comments are off the record.
    -   If the witness is represented by the attorney, watch out if that attorney tries to take something off the record that is important and should remain. Keep in mind that this is your deposition, and make sure everything you want in the record will be reflected there.
     
    5 **Know when to stop.** While you may have heard of depositions lasting four of five hours, not every deposition needs to be a lengthy question-and-answer marathon. When you've got all the information you need, the deposition is over – even if it only lasted 20 minutes.[[26]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-26) [[27]](https://www.wikihow.legal/Take-a-Deposition#_note-27)
    
    -   If you adequately prepared for the deposition, you know what your purpose is, and you'll know when you've fulfilled that purpose.
    -   Avoid asking questions simply for the sake of asking questions. It can confuse your record and make it difficult for you to find the information you need in the transcript later, because you'll have to wade through pages and pages of unimportant discussion.
