Peer Mentor Training Program  
for People with I/DD

Peer mentoring encompasses a range of activities and interactions between people who share similar experiences living with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities.

Peer mentoring offers a level of acceptance, understanding, and validation not found in many other professional relationships. By sharing their own lived experience and practical guidance, peer mentors help people to develop their own goals, create strategies for self-empowerment, and take concrete steps towards building fulfilling, self-determined lives for themselves.

We believe that peer-to-peer support (mentoring) can help individuals with I/DD lead more self-directed, autonomous, and satisfying lives in their communities. Join us and learn more…
