Custody hearings are stressful.  No doubt about that.  I wanted to share a recap of my last one where everything that could go wrong DID go wrong and I can *almost* laugh about it now.

The hearing was scheduled to start via Zoom at 8 a.m. sharp with a ten-minute early sign-on.  I had to drop my kids at school no earlier than 7:45 that morning.

That gave me 5 minutes to be set up and ready.

I knew I couldn't get back home by then and there was nothing open in Rigby, Idaho at damn 7:45 a.m. with wifi.

I did what any of us would do (right?!).  I rented a room in the local Motel 6 about 5 minutes from the school for the night before just so I would have a place to be with wifi at 7:50 a.m. the next morning. 

Easy. I went and checked in the night before and made sure my laptop would connect.  I can't begin to describe the atmosphere except to say that had my dog crapped in the corner of the room, it would have been an improvement. But, the wifi signal was strong and I'd brought some canned coffee and a snack to leave there for the morning.

I dropped the kids at school the next morning and shot out onto the highway like a bat out of hell for the motel room.

Once I get there, of course the laptop won't connect now and the desk dude was gone and left a cloud of Marijuana in his place.  Great.  No help.

My phone!!  It connected!  Not the best venue, but it freaking connected and I had 1 minute to spare. 

In that one minute, I thought I'd better go pee (coffee and anxiety...). 

The bathroom in this room.  THE BATHROOM IN THIS ROOM.

I heard the "plop" and nearly had a seizure.  I'd tucked my phone in the back pocket of my pants and it was now at the bottom of the toilet bowl.

Did I mention that I'm a nurse?  No?  Well it gets important here. 

Abandoning reason, I jammed my hand into the bowl like greased lightening and snatched the phone from the murky waters of an unclean Motel 6 toilet hoping to hell I could still connect. 

I can't lose by not "showing up", after all this time.  We waited 6 months for this Zoom hearing. Six months of pure hell and abuse because there weren't orders in place.

Lo and behold!  The phone still works! 

I log in and can't even believe it.

Except.

When I finally get to speak and I am unmuted, the microphone doesn't work.

At all.

My ex's lawyer laughs and makes a lame remark about how I don't know how to un-mute myself.  I can't even call my attorney to tell him what's happening. 

I basically lost everything I wanted to gain and another 6 months is slowly going by before I get the chance to speak for myself again. 

And, my arm was covered in real shit and dripping wet while I floundered. 

No matter how well you lay your plans, you might just be forced to sit on your hands and survive.

It's sort of funny, right?
