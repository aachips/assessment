# Lindsay Lohan Today Could Be in the Same Conservatorship as Britney Spears
‘Seeking Sister Wife’ Season 4: April, Nick, and Jennifer Davis Explain Their Sex Schedule

Former teen idols Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears have a lot in common, but today their lives are very different. They both rose to stardom in the late 1990s and early 2000s and were the subject of intense media coverage over personal struggles and substance abuse. Shortly after Spears’ father, Jamie Spears took control of her finances with a conservatorship in 2008, Lohan’s father looked to do the same. Here’s what happened.


## **Where is Lindsay Lohan today?**

Lindsay Lohan currently resides in Dubai today. However, she is planning a Hollywood comeback and a return to the United States in the future.

After Lohan starred in numerous movies and television shows in the early 2000s, she moved into the music industry. The 34-year-old made her stage debut in London in 2014-2015. Beginning in 2016, she started opening nightclubs and resorts in Greece. 

In 2019 Lohan became one of the judge panelists on the Australian edition of _The Masked Singer_. She was scheduled to return for season 2 of the series; however, she could not travel from Dubai to Melbourne to film because of the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions.

On April 3, 2020, Lohan released her new album’s first single, “Back to Me.” She also has several upcoming films, including _Frame_, which she will star in. The actor is writing the script for a movie based on the book _Honeymoon_. Although the pandemic might have changed Lohan’s plans to return to the U.S., she has many other business ventures, including a new jewelry line — Lily Baker Jewels.

## **What happened to Lindsay Lohan?**

Lindsay Lohan fell into similar trouble as Britney Spears around 2006. She spent much of the year dealing with legal issues from probation violations and drug and alcohol abuse. The singer-songwriter began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in 2007 and then checked into a rehabilitation center.

However, things continued to get worse for the teen idol. In the following years, she continued to party, drink, and steal. In 2013, after six stints in rehab, she admitted to Oprah that she was an addict. Lohan said her drug of choice was alcohol but that it was a gateway to other things. When the host asked her what Lohan was trying to mask by drinking, she admitted to a rough family life.

Lindsay Lohan has struggled with several problems, much like Britney Spears and Amanda Bynes. She began going to AA meetings in 2007 and checked herself into a treatment center. But, unfortunately, things got much worse for her. By 2013, she had gone through six stints in treatment facilities, and she went on Oprah to discuss her troubled family life when she was younger.

Michael Lohan, Lindsay’s father, saw the conservatorship for Britney Spears, so he approached his lawyer to begin the same type of guardianship for his daughter. So far, Lindsay’s father has failed to gain a conservatorship, but he won’t stop trying. Hopefully, Lindsay can get her life in order to avoid anything like Britney has gone through.
