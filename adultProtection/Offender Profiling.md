Offender profiling is proposed to help identify the most likely characteristics of the offender. This may help in narrowing down the search of suspects to those people who have the key characteristics that have been identified. However, it has never been proposed that offender profiling can identify precisely who committed a crime.

  

An organised offender may appear somewhat disorganised if elements of the situation when they went to offend took them by surprise. For example, there may have been more people present than the offender anticipated. Or the victim may have been stronger than anticipated and so violently fought back.

  

Professional profilers only outperformed non-profilers on the sexual offense case. Professional profilers did not outperform non-profilers on the homicide case.

  

The signature is an individualised or specific way of offending that the FBI in their Criminal Investigative Analysis approach suggests tells you about the personality of the offender. This may be useful in linking this crime to other crimes where the same signature has been seen.

  

Interpersonal coherence, one element’s of Canter’s five factor model for interpreting a crime scene, suggests that the way in which people interact with one another in their everyday lives is so well rehearsed and ingrained that it influences all their interactions with others, including the way in which they interact with their victims while offending.

  

The Investigative Psychology approach states that where offender's offend is not random. They select the time and location of their offending for a reason and investigators may be able to infer something about the offender based on their choices about when and where to offend.

  

Much like offender profiling, geographical profiling cannot tell you precisely where the base of an offender is (i.e., their home). However it can help narrow down a search area by identifying the most likely area in which the offender’s base will be found.

  

It is suggested that offender's may show a preference for crime sites closer to their home. It is at these sites that offender's may feel more knowledgeable or in control. However in their offences they may avoid a ‘buffer zone’ around their home or base where they may feel that they would be recognised.

  

The way you interact with a given environment will impact on the areas in that environment that you note as significant. For example, if you catch public transport to work or college then you will provide more detail about public transport stops or stations than someone who drives to work or college.
