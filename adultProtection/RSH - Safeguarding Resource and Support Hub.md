# What is RSH?

### What is the Safeguarding Resource and Support Hub?

The Safeguarding Resource and Support Hub (RSH) aims to support organisations in the aid sector to strengthen their safeguarding policy and practice against Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Sexual Harassment (SEAH). The Hub’s core offer is this online open-access platform bringing together quality assured guidance, tools, support and research on safeguarding, serving any organisation working in the international aid sector. However, smaller, local organisations in developing countries are the focus of the Hub’s offer as they tend to have less access to safeguarding resources than international organisations.

RSH has launched this Online Hub – a one-stop shop for relevant and accessible safeguarding materials on June 1st 2020. The Hub also signposts users towards quality assured safeguarding service providers and creates opportunities for meaningful engagement through discussion forums and live events. Any organisation working in the aid sector can access the Online Hub to learn, share and improve their approaches to SEAH and safeguarding more broadly. Additionally, a National Hub is being piloted in Ethiopia that offers both virtual and face-to-face services. The Ethiopia Hub page on the website provides contextually relevant resources in local languages as well as access to a free call-down service for tailored advice and support on safeguarding for eligible CSOs in Ethiopia.

The Hub is also be a repository for the increasing volume of SEAH safeguarding materials, much of which has been developed in recent years in response to high profile SEAH cases within the sector. There are also important contributions dating back further over the last two decades, a reflection of the dedicated and determined work of activists, leaders, survivors, researchers and others working in this area.  Where the Hub staff or its users identify major gaps in evidence, guidance or opportunities, we will look for ways to fill them, in collaboration with other partners and networks.

The Hub will evolve in response to user engagement and feedback. We want people who come to the site to become regular visitors, to actively engage in discussions, to share new materials, information and opportunities – and to feel a sense of ownership.
