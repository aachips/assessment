You can teach someone to fish, but if you are taking them out fishing to learn how to fish, don't make them watch you eat lunch while you eat the fish you taught them how to catch. Feed them some fish. They are hungry. Give them some fish. That's why you went out fishing.

[Contact Us | NC Peer Support Specialist Certification Program (unc.edu)](https://pss.unc.edu/contact-us)

My name is April Cyr. I am a high-functioning adult on the autism spectrum. When I was 22, I graduated from college with honors in Psychology. At 23, I was accepted into a Master of Social Work program at a competitive school. I deferred because of ethical and financial considerations. At 24, I became homeless and lived in a car. At 25, I fled my hometown and drove hundreds of miles away to a city where I knew one person with no plan. At 26, I legally changed my name, became documented in North Carolina, and registered for social services. At 27, I got housed in an exploitative situation in Haywood County. At 28, I left there and fought to get into the rent system, fearing that I’d never escape a cycle of homelessness. I’ve been in safe housing and living in sobriety since, struggling to relearn basic life skills. I have sought help from the Health and Human Services Division of Mental Health Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services (NC HHS DMHDDSAS).

At 29, I went to a career expo at the Autism Society; out of the ten employers there, only one reached out and suggested getting my Peer Support Specialist Certification because I would be a great candidate. I applied in September of 2021; I was notified that my application was received and accepted in December. I was told there wasn’t any training happening locally and that I would be notified when they had one. I was informed about a virtual exercise in March and wanted to attend, but I had a necessary surgery I scheduled for March 11th, so I opted to wait for the next one. I needed the virtual option because of reasons beyond the scope of this complaint. I was told that was the last virtual training being offered and that Vaya Health had ‘met their quota’ of virtual training. I asked if I could get more information, maybe because there were tech issues or frustrations around hosting a training over Zoom.

I begged the course facilitator, Rebekah McCoy, to help navigate reasonable accommodations or let me help in the planning of future training to work towards Hybrid options or having a designated Self-Paced course set up. I was told to contact the Peer Support Board at UNC-Chapel Hill School of Social Work. I was told that this accommodation is out of their realm of decision-making. I tried navigating Vaya Health, which is our regional Managed Care Organization which oversees and governs these trainings. I could not navigate outside of their mental health responder network to reach a manager or administrative source. 

On August 30th, 2022, I was removed from the Peer Support Specialist training waiting list after explicitly asking for reasonable accommodation the months before. I submitted my completed application to enroll for the training on October 15th, 2021. It was in January 2022 that I was informed of being approved and that training was happening in early March. Because of a surgery that I had been waiting for for over a year that would have taken me out of class for half a day, I deferred for later training. I was surprised to find out that March 9-13 would have been the last time Vaya Health offered the Virtual Training over Zoom. After that, all training would be in person. I informed the instructor that I was not physically able to complete the forty-hour in-person training. I know the forty-hour in-person training program is by Health and Human Services, not VAYA Health. I was told VAYA Health 'met their coronavirus quota' for virtual training and were discontinuing these. I had heard from specialists that there is an intention to make this training Hybrid (in-person and virtually accessible) and offered to help in setting that up. I want to be included in those planning conversations. Every attempt to speak to officials from VAYA resulted in either being redirected to the wrong places, being told that the idea is good with no follow-up action or being referred to VAYA's inaccessible crisis line. To state that this treatment is discriminatory and hurtful is an understatement. To be rejected from an entire field that is marketed as being for peers like me is excruciating and encourages me to relapse from my recovery. 

It hasn’t just been the peer support training. I have hit dead ends repeatedly, attempting to find services and support for over three years with VAYA agencies for help with Augmented Communication (AAC) and Supported Employment. I am a full-time student at A-B Tech now; using my background in Behavioral Psychology and Social Work to learn Computer Science, Web Development, and Digital Accessibility. That way others may not need to suffer the way I did. I have yet to find Peer Support Specialists with mobility issues, autism spectrum conditions, nonverbal mutism, or anyone who isn’t naturally extroverted and high energy. If I can’t find peers like myself, people like me are not welcome in the field. 

I've been on the waitlist for the PSS training in North Carolina. I wanted to take the virtual training offered in March but had to cancel because of overlapping surgery. Now everyone is telling me the 'quota has been fulfilled' for doing a year of virtual access classes. I am a disabled adult. I have long haul covid, fatigue and chronic health issues that make it almost impossible for me to show up at 8:30 every morning and be there for 8 hours for five days.
 
Under Title I(Employment) & Title III(Public Accommodations) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I am urging compliance to make Peer Support an accessible field for people who cannot do forty hours of in-person training. This is for Peers seeking support and Peer Support Specialists getting certified and employed. VAYA Health and Human Services DMHSASDD have unfairly and unjustly discriminated against people like me because of the lack of reasonable accommodations and restrictive requirements to become a certified Peer Support Specialist in North Carolina.

I've witnessed individuals over the years who have been barred from getting Peer Certification in NC because they had Fibromyalgia, or Mobility Issues, or no way to get there. By way of the structure, the only people who can get certified are extroverted, high-energy, non-disabled people. I would have benefited in the past years from having a Peer Support Specialist like me. It would have saved me from a lot of hardship and pain.

I have an attainable and realistic vision of what advancing the field of Peer Support can look like, and I have included writings I have done for school. My Resume is included, too. I am a graduate-level full-time student at A-B Tech Community College studying a mix of Human Services and Computer Technology. 
 
I want to work with you to develop or approve a self-paced version of the course that retains its integrity, social connectedness, and commitment to the policies of the state program. I am in school at A-B Tech as a full-time student, learning how to make engaging and accessible online learning environments. I'd really like a conversation, or at the very least, I would appreciate the opportunity to do my best this upcoming training to attend as many hours as possible without the implied threat of failing and having to pay the next go around. As online support services develop, there will be more need for Certified Specialists, particularly online.

There are more written materials I'd like to attach, but can't with this form.

Hi Glenda Stokes
My name is April Cyr. I have been seeking to resolve an issue around Peer Support Certification in North Carolina and the Americans with Disabilities Act. I'd really like to find a time to talk. I am filing a complaint. I have it ready to print and mail. The closest thing to the date of the incident was getting dropped from the Waiting list on august 30th, and it is exactly day 60 as I leave this voicemail. My Disability Rights advocate had said you were the person to talk to, and your name is on the the ADA/RA coordinator list for the DMH. I'm a full time student at AB Tech studying how to do virtual learning spaces right and I want to also send you some writings I did on conducting successful virtual trainings and payable computer roles for Peer Support Specialists. It would mean a lot to be able to meet with you and talk about the subject matter. My number is 615-502-0384

In Halloween of 2010, I had a death experience brought on by overdose and hypothermia. Not intentional, just young me being stupid. My health crashed after that and I started seeing ghosts and having spirit dream encounters. One of them latched onto me and acted as my better half. It's been twelve years together.
