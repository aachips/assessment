Thank you for finding the time to speak with me today about the Care Manager position offered at RHA Health Asheville. Unfortunately we have determined that another candidate is more qualified for the requirements of our employment needs. The purpose of this message is to let you know you have not been selected citing the following reason: lack of accessibility, quality, and competence of care experienced as IDD adult at your facilities, paired with lackluster effort to remediate said structural challenges. We encourage you to stay connected over LinkedIn and are open to future communications. Please fix the migraine elevator at your Asheville facility.

Hi dr ___ I am a advocate for one of your patients who saw you at this date and this time. Their mother tried to get you to write a script for Aderall for them. Do not offer this script. she is malingering for drugs. it is a case of forced anorexia, this is the number for the investigator if you observe anything suspicious
