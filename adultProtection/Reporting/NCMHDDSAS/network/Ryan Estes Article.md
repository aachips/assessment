The Commission was created in 1973 to promote excellence in prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs for persons with mental illness, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders. 

Estes provides fiscal, policy, and clinical oversight to Coastal Horizons’ programs in 27 counties. He was both instrumental and successful in building Coastal Horizons’ Child First, Day Treatment, and Intensive Family Preservation services. 

Estes is also a professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington in the Master of Social Work program, and serves on the National and North Carolina State Board of Directors for the National Association of Social Workers.
