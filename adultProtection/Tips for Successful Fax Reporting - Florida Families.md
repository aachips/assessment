## How to Report

### Tips for Successful Fax Reporting

Your time is valuable. Everyone at the Florida Abuse Hotline is committed to making the reporting process as convenient as possible. The following tips are provided to assist you in making reports of abuse, neglect, abandonment, and exploitation of children and/or vulnerable adults.

-   Use the Department of Children and Families' form when possible. It is designed to help you provide the required information.
-   If you cannot use the Department's form, please send a concise description of the situation. Be sure to include the following information:
    -   Victim name, possible responsible person, or alleged perpetrator name(s).
    -   Reporter name (required for mandatory reporters).
    -   Complete addresses for subjects, including a numbered street address, apartment or lot number, city, state, and zip code.
    -   Telephone numbers, including area code.
    -   Dates of birth.
    -   Social Security numbers, if available.
    -   A brief, yet concise, description of the abuse, neglect, abandonment, or exploitation, including physical, mental or sexual injuries, if any.
    -   Names and telephone numbers and/or addresses of witnesses and others involved.
    -   A brief description of the victim's disability or infirmity (required for vulnerable adults).
    -   The relationship of the alleged perpetrator to the victim.
-   Please print or write in a legible manner. Type, if at all possible.
-   Do not use profession-specific language; i.e., "fx" for fracture.
-   Do NOT send copies of medical notes, case files, arrest reports, etc.
-   Always call 1-800-96ABUSE in emergency or critical situations. The time required to process a fax may be longer than the time required to process information given in a telephone call. This could delay assistance to victims.
