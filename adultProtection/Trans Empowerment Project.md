## **DONATE NOW** 

We have provided direct aid for over 1200 Trans* people across the U.S. since we launched in 2016.

This includes folks who are queer, trans, non-binary, two-spirit, gender non-conforming, and of other identities. Our main focus is on the liberation and success of disabled Trans* people of color.

[Donate Now](https://transempowerment.salsalabs.org/GeneralFund)

Your donation will help us continue our work.

**We can not claim actual equality in this country until disabled trans people of color are THRIVING!**

It’s time to stop the hateful attacks against marginalized communities and start creating more collaborative and supportive spaces. 

####  END WHITE SUPREMACY

Trans rights are human rights, yet we are too often denied access to even the most basic and vital of resources. 

We will never truly achieve equity until disabled Trans people of color are THRIVING. 

If you’re not building equity with us in mind, you aren’t building equity.

#### TAKE BACK THE NARRATIVE

![Jack Knoxville telling his story at a stop hate rally](https://www.transempowerment.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/7_0_300_300_jack_rally-768x754.jpg)

It’s our story, we should be the ones to tell it.

Since 2021, we’ve seen over 100 horrible pieces of anti-trans legislation proposed around the US.

These queer and transphobic ideals have been targeting all Trans* people including trans youth, trans athletes, at school and in bathrooms, challenging our ability to exist. 

Mostly because the GOP and the misinformed religious right have been controlling the narrative of who we are. 

(Re)claim your power through storytelling. One of the oldest, proven tactics of organizing that we have in our toolbox.
