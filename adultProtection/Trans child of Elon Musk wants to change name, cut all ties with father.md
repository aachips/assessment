SANTA MONICA, Calif. (TND) — The transgender daughter of billionaire Elon Musk reportedly wishes to legally change her name in an effort to better align with her gender identity and also distance herself from her father.

In a petition filed with the Los Angeles County Superior Court in Santa Monica, Xavier Alexander Musk stated they were seeking both a name change and a new birth certificate, according to several news reports including [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/elon-musks-child-seeks-name-change-sever-ties-with-father-2022-06-21/ "https://www.reuters.com/world/elon-musks-child-seeks-name-change-sever-ties-with-father-2022-06-21/") and [TMZ.](https://www.tmz.com/2022/06/20/elon-musk-daughter-name-change-transgender-court-filing/ "https://www.tmz.com/2022/06/20/elon-musk-daughter-name-change-transgender-court-filing/")

> I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form," Xavier Alexander reportedly says in the petition.

Xavier Alexander recently turned 18 and filed the petition in April, Reuters reports, adding the news of the desired name change [only started being reported recently.](https://twitter.com/KnowNothingTV/status/1538783473640546304 "https://twitter.com/KnowNothingTV/status/1538783473640546304")  

The court has been asked by Xavier Alexander to change her gender recognition from male to female and to register her new name, Vivian Jenna Wilson, taking on the name of her mother, Justine Wilson, [according to TMZ.](https://www.tmz.com/2022/06/20/elon-musk-daughter-name-change-transgender-court-filing/ "https://www.tmz.com/2022/06/20/elon-musk-daughter-name-change-transgender-court-filing/")

Justine Wilson, who divorced Musk in 2008, took to Twitter to [share a conversation](https://twitter.com/justinemusk/status/1538977165462491136 "https://twitter.com/justinemusk/status/1538977165462491136") she had with her 18-year-old child, saying she was "very proud."  

> 'I had a weird childhood,' my 18 year old said to me. 'I can't believe I'm as normal-seeming as I am,'" Wilson tweets. "I said, 'I'm very proud of you,'" to which Wilson's child replied "I'm proud of myself!" according to her mother.

Elon Musk himself has spoken publically about how he is in support of transgender people but dislikes the subject of pronouns and such.

"I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare," Musk [tweeted in Dec. 2020](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1339253909546823682 "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1339253909546823682"), expanding on a previous tweet [he wrote in June 2020](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1286869404874088448 "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1286869404874088448") which simply said, "Pronouns suck."  

Musk recently took to Twitter to wish everyone a "Happy Father's Day," and followed up that statement by saying ["I love all my kids so much."](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1538399223317676035 "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1538399223317676035")

A hearing for Xavier Alexander's potential name change is reportedly set for Friday.
