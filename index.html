            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Apple Chip Autism is not meant for diagnosis! This tool is effectively a compilation of experiences adults with intellectual developmental disabilities may run into. It has no medical or legal legitimacy as of now whatsoever. Use at your own risk. For this reason, we wish to compile metrics about the visitors who wish to utilize this information and have a vested interest in the success of the tool. See our <a href="">Privacy Policy & Metrics</a> page for more information on that.</p>

            <h2>Questionnaire structure</h2>
            <h3>Assessment Measures</h3>
            <p>There are 188 questions in the measure, divided into seven sections, each representing different areas of life that can be a strength or a weakness to a disabled adult. Every one of these questions in every section, is linked to helpful terminology, information, and resources.</p>
    
            <h3>Calculating a score</h3>
            <p>Each of these seven sections carries a different score. There is no combined universal total. Each question will ask for a self-report of:
              <ol>
                <li>Frequency (0-6)</li>
                <li>Severity (0-6)</li>
                <li>Hyper or Hypo- Activity (-1, 1)</li>
              </ol>
            <p>For any given question, you may score between -36, to 36. A score of -36 on a measure would indicate that this happens very frequently, it is very severe and interferes with quality of life, and that this specific phenomenon represents Hypo- (low range/lack of) activity. +36 would indicate Hyper- (High range/high level of) activity, which is very frequent and very disruptive to a good quality of life.</p>
    
            <h3>Hypo-Activity & Hyper-Activity</h3>
            <img src="diagram.png" alt="" width="600" height="450">
    
            <h3>Dialectical Score Modeling</h3>
            <p>An individual can exhibit in any area a mix of hyper and hypo active behaviors. Each section is scored with a negative and positive integer in the format of (negative number, positive number). One question having -36 and one having positive 36 does not cancel out to 0. Instead, each section will have a total score representing Hypo(negative) and Hyper(positive).</p>
    
            <h3>What a high range disordered set of behaviors may look like on any given section</h3>
            <p>I have put together this outline for a non-diagnostic Assessment tool for Adults that are on the Autism Spectrum. This meant following and moderating popular support groups for Adults on the Spectrum and keeping an index of all the Experiential Glossary for as many sub-experiences of being on the Spectrum, that has been given a name. They are experiences that span over six different Pillars of Life Experiences: Body & 'Me', Social Interactions, Executive Functioning, Independent Living, Relationships, & Play (can be sexuality-related, asexuality identities too). The measures identify if the person relates to the experience, if it is a consistent problem in their life, and rank it between Hypo- and Hyper- relations to said measure. Answers are scored on a model to the RAADS-R, however, the measures I have written are more inclusive and equitable of experiences in all of those six Pillars. We track some metrics for possible future research purposes. Based on which experiences you select as significant in your life, the tool at the end will use an algorithm to share with the subject anecdotes about other people experiencing the same things, and helpful strategies shared to help improve the quality of lives without professional interventions.</p>

            <p>This index is modeled after several assessment tools that I would like to credit:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="">MOSAIC - Gavin de Becker's Online Threat Assessment Tool (oprah.com)</a>, which is a Domestic Violence Threat Assessment Tool featured on Oprah, and used by Secret Service to assist in the protection of Judicial Officials. The aspect of this assessment that stands out most is the interactivity of information regarding risk assessment and safety. This is a tool that saves lives.</li>  
              <li><a href="">Dr. Christina Maslachs MBI Maslach Burnout Inventory</a>. Dr. Maslach has studied Workplace Burnout for several decades, been a leading researcher in the topic, and has developed an assessment tool to track workplace related burnout. The MBI utilizes a frequency measure from 0 to 6, and separates into sub-topics which accurately model the phenomenon in an easy to understand way.</li> 
              <li><a href="">The RAADS-R assessment</a> is a free assessment tool for signs of Autism and ADHD. While it is not a substitute for a clinical diagnosis, it gives access to a measure which reputably has a 97% accuracy and validity rating. <a href="">If you want to read about my criticisms and critiques of this assessment and how Apple Chip Autism differs, you can do so by clicking here</a>.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>The web page format of this was coded from scratch by me, April Cyr. It is coded in HTML5, CSS3, and PHP7.4 for usability, aesthetic, and accessibility. <a href="">If you would like to understand more about my commitment to Web Accessibility, and about these different web languages, you can do so here.</a></p>

            <h4>Body & Me</h4>
            <h5>Hyper</h5>
            <p>Very high attention given to body. Engaging in obsessive behaviors over feeding, sleeping, hygiene, grooming, bodily routine structures every day.</p>
            <h5>Hypo</h5>
            <p>Low self-awareness of body. May need to be reminded to engage in daily self-care routines. Can be at risk for self-neglect. </p>

                Details: Alexithymia & Hyper-Reactivity. ‘Feeling Blindness’ and delayed affect can often be symptoms of neurological differences. Hypo- slower affectivity, sometimes seeming emotionally aloof. Hyper- can have the clinical expression of Bipolar or Manic Depressive Disorders.</li>

                Details: While drug use is not responsible for causing lifelong developmental disabilities like ADHD or Autism, people with these conditions may be more likely to self-medicate or be prescribed drugs for long term daily use to regulate behavioral and mood issues.

            <h4>Executive Functioning</h4>
            <h5>Hyper</h5>
            <p>May resemble obsessive and compulsive behaviors around a home environment. Can often mask anxiety with complex repetitive focused tasks such as cleaning, writing, or other hobbies. This can look like overachiever or perfectionist behavior, which from the outside may not seem disordered, but internally there may be pervasive fear and intrusive thoughts.</p>
            <h5>Hypo</h5>
            <p>Puts off daily tasks such as cleaning, bathing, clothing, work, and commitments. This is not laziness, the person often wants to do these things desperately, but cannot break larger tasks into smaller easier tasks.</p>

            <p>Extremely independent, does not like asking others for help. Would rather do something themselves poorly than seek assistance from someone qualified. Can be very ambitious and push away intimacy with others.</p>
            <h5>Hypo</h5>
            <p>Highly reliant on others to perform day to day tasks. May need direct care provider(s) through Medicaid or family and friends.</p>
