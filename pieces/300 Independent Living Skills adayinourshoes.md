## Transition IEP Goals

We all want our kids to live as independently as possible. Sometimes when I think about it, I kinda can’t believe that my Dad just dropped me off somewhere 150 miles away and expected me to figure it out. They never gave me any instruction, just expected me to learn by watching.

I hafta say, I _nailed it_ as far as the [social skills](https://adayinourshoes.com/tag/social-skills/ "social skills") component of college. The other stuff? Not so much. I ate poorly, overdrew my bank account repeatedly and made poor safety decisions. Sure, the argument can be made that I would have done some of that stuff anyway. But, I had the ability to learn these skills, just no one ever taught them to me.

As your child enters transition age for their IEP, here is a list of skills you can look at and start to form a plan of what needs to be accomplished.

It’s important to remember, and to encourage our kids, that for some of them these skills may not be evident right now. But, that doesn’t mean that they are not attainable. Some kids may not be ready for this until age 20, 25 or even later. _And that’s ok_.

I’ve had several clients over the years who were not ready for these things by age 17 or 18 and felt defeated by that.

## IEP Transition Goals and Objectives

You may look at this list and say, “hey, you said these were **[IEP transition](https://adayinourshoes.com/iep-transition/)** goals! These are just independent living skills!”

However, it’s easy to form them into transition **[IEP goals and objectives](https://adayinourshoes.com/iep-goal-bank/)**. To make them measurable, you plug the skill into the formula below.

To make it a goal with objectives, you add the subsets of skills to the main skill.

For example “student will demonstrate independence in completing banking skills necessary for independent living” or something like that. Then, add in the objectives such as creating a budget, explain the concept of saving, demonstrate how to use a check card, demonstrate what to do if card is declined, etc.

![IEP goal formula for special education](https://adayinourshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IEP-goal-formula-600x600.png)

## Independent Living Skills

I compiled this list from numerous lists I saw online to make it more comprehensive. The printable list of independent living skills is at the bottom of the post.

It may seem overwhelming. And, you might be doing some of these skills and tasks for your child. That’s fine! That is what supported living is all about. What’s important is that maximum level of independence is being supported. And that your child is as independent and as _safe_ as possible.

I saw some outdated sentences. Things like referencing payphones and phone books. So I changed those but please let me know if you find another error.
