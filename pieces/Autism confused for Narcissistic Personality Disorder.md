Q: Can Autism be confused for Narcissism? Can the symptoms overlap?

Yes, they can overlap but generally what happens is unqualified people attempt to diagnose others. It's really inappropriate to do so. There are some surface overlaps with autism and narcissistic personality disorder. Under scrutiny they break down and aren't comparable. An example of this is controlling behavior.
  
Someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder may engage in very controlling behaviors to manipulate the free will of others. Someone with Autism may be very controlling because they need their environment and surroundings to be a certain way.

Someone with NPD may have severe deficits in empathy and appear cold and menacing. Someone with ASD may experience feelings and affect differently, be consistently disregulated and grumpy, and be uncomfortable making eye contact.
 
Both are generally very self-absorbed, for very different reasons. 
I'm not diagnosing or treating anyone. 

There is a surface-level overlap of presenting symptoms. This isn't a published academic topic. It comes up a lot on these support groups. If you'd like to discuss the topic I am willing to talk about it. Here's a non-academic source that talks about this phenomenon. Again, I'm not claiming this from a standpoint of research. I am claiming this from the standpoint of personally experiencing this and hearing from others who personally experience this. [https://hereonthespectrum.com/autism-narcissism-connection/]      HEREONTHESPECTRUM.COM  
Autism & Narcissism: The Connection & Differences

This is just a list of general presentation symptoms associated with NPD. Just what shows up on google with a simple search. Which is what a lot of people on the internet do to make psychological assessments of others. Let's do a run-through of NPD symptoms here:

 -Overly boastful and exaggerating, monopolizing conversations: Think about how it can come across socially if an autistic person infodumps in a conversation.

-Impatient, angry, unhappy, depressed, or has mood swings when criticized: The amount of sensory issues faced by someone on the spectrum can make somebody grumpy and act like this. I get this way when my environment is too loud. And if someone criticizes me during this? I am going to be irritable.

 -Picky/"Craves the best" I did homecare for an autistic male adult who would eat nothing but steak and box pancake mix. Refuse to eat anything else. WHat happens when you cook a delicious meal for a hungry person and they refuse to eat the food? Might get a little frustrated and jump to assumptions about their character.

 -Fragile self-esteem: Autistic people do not do well with criticism and insults either.
