 Capacity vs Competency..  
They have subtle differences which are important for a Case Manager to understand. A Clinical Provider may assess the capacity of a person, but competence is a legal concept, where deeming someone incompetent is done by a Judge, and may result in someone being assigned a Guardian or Conservator.  
  
The way I distinguish the two, which may not be completely right. If somebody cannot handle money because they are terrible with math and numbers, and they tried to learn, but it just never works out, and they need help handling financial matters and budgeting, that is an issue of competence.  
  
If somebody cannot handle money because they were never taught and never given opportunities to manage money, all their money decisions were made for them. That may be an issue of capacity. They may be capable of learning. They may be capable of making sound decisions. They could be given financial management, budgeting, and money skills training to expand their capacity.  
  
Competence is based on global decision making determined by a court.  
  
Capacity is often around specific decisions, and can be expanded with support and learning.  
  
This factsheet does a pretty good job of explaining the difference.
