The term co-parenting is taken so lightly in this generation. You aren’t a co-parent if you only see your kid on the weekend. You aren’t co-parenting if you just pay child support. Co-parenting is when two parents are equally involved in their kid’s life/activities & share equal responsibilities & obligations. Co-parenting is I drop him off you pick him up. I bring game snacks this week, you take them next week. I can’t make it to the teacher conference so you pick up my slack. She has an extra expense this month & it’s your turn bc I got the last one. If the other parent cannot count on you like that then you’re not their co-parent. This trend of weekend or part time is not parenting. You simply visit with your child. There is one parent maintaining the child, doing it all while the other parent hangs out with the kids on a couple of weekends a month doing cool/fun stuff. You are single with a kid(s) you get sometimes & live your life freely the other 90% of the time without the obligations & responsibilities the primary parent is obligated to. There is in fact a huge difference.
