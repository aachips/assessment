Think about Autism, how it was understood twenty years ago, and how it’s understood today. There’s a pretty big gap there.  
  
There is a pretty big gap between, “if diagnosed as a child, it’s child apraxia of speech, meaning they were born with it” and if “as an adult if it’s acquired through neurological disturbances it’s Apraxia of Speech.” 

  
9 y/o kid crashes bike, has a TBI. Or drowning survivor with permanent brain damage.  
6 y/o learns to avoid conflict with parent by not talking over lockdown isolation.   

Child sex trauma Survivor feels gross engaging in speech so is more comfortable existing mute. 

Transgender Adolescent going through wrong puberty has low self-esteem and loathing over their voice.

I can’t speak for it, but I’m sure there are plenty of childhood acquired speech issues around racial and cultural codeswitching having to do with shame and stigma on how a child speaks. 

  

These are all plenty statistically common. What is the Apraxia label for that?
