# My Mom Has No Friends

 

## The loneliness of growing older made bearable with playdates.

My mom Veronica is 80. She used to be [popular](https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-make-friends-as-an-adult.html). In one of my earliest memories, she sits at a kitchen table in Queens, spilling her mug of instant coffee as she cackles with her [best friend](https://www.thecut.com/article/hola-papi-i-wish-i-had-a-best-friend.html). When we later moved to New Jersey, her work pals from the local real-estate agency popped by in the afternoon to gossip and listen to Billy Joel. “I’m movin’ out!” Veronica would sing, with a fist pump. In 1990, my parents [divorced](https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-help-your-friend-through-divorce.html) and Mom, at the age of 48, found a whole new set of salty middle-age singles who borrowed her Anne Klein leather miniskirt for dates with divorced men.

Before COVID-19 and before her second husband fell off a ladder and died in September 2020, she was known for hosting spontaneous dinner parties in her Florida community for a dozen couples. “Hey, if you have enough booze and play Steely Dan, no one cares about the food,” Veronica would say. But her vast network of couple [friends](https://www.thecut.com/2022/03/friendships-after-pandemic.html) withered as the pandemic spread: Older folks isolated, people who lost a partner moved closer to their adult kids. Being a widow, she told me once, was a social liability: “They don’t know what to do with you at dinner parties.” In the span of about six months, her circle of about 20 friends and acquaintances had shrunk to two [widowed](https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/how-i-got-this-baby-the-widow-co-parenting-with-her-dad.html) women. One of them was battling cancer and didn’t feel comfortable socializing during the pandemic.
