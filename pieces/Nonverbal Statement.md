**I want to explain this once to those who do not understand what I'm talking about when I say 'Non-Verbal' or 'Selective Mute.' I can often be wholly able and OK to speak by phone call, chat messages, in person. I'm not even going to talk about mail here. Those spend energy I need for day-to-day tasks. I often don't have the life to speak on the phone with people I like. I may need to deal with agencies and bureaucratic agents that week. I may be applying for paid work and using my emotional energy on that. When I was housing insecure, I might have needed to make calls to get shelter when it's 10 degrees. Many of these require me to be emotionally vulnerable and naked to people who often don't care.

  

 I hit a certain kind of mode; I retract from communicating out of anxiety, fear, and overwhelm. I'm probably fine there but may not be. I might be in crisis mode and unable to talk about it. I may be totally in a good mood, unable to communicate in ways people recognize. I will be completely mute and withdrawn from everyone! Sometimes in this place, I will share by memes. But it isn't a reflex of laziness, uncaring, non-action, or blowing you off. It's a part of my brain completely shutting down, probably in response to situations in the past where shutting up was the best method of surviving. 

  

I recognize that the cold shoulder is often cruel and unusual punishment. I realize that most fulfilling and whole relationships to many people mean consistent and ongoing communication. I recognize that I have probably blown off every person in my life and that real-world consequences result from that. I understand that I hide from being vulnerable by being facetious and sarcastic. I acknowledge that I have hurt and likely will continue to hurt people I care about because they don't understand what's going on when I withdraw. I work on bettering myself and want to improve my relations. I also need understanding, which is why I write this.

  

Holding work when you can't communicate half the time doesn't work out. Ghosting out is recognized as a shitty thing to do while dating, and it's going to happen. My family has hated and resented me for this. I've lost housing over this. I've dropped off the face of the Earth from people I care about for years at a time because my social network becomes too challenging to keep up. If I take the time to talk to you, I care about our relationship. Or I enjoy talking to you. Or Both! But probably just one of the two. I don't want to be naked on this platform. If I share my writings with you, I trust you. 

  

If I don't want to talk to you, it may be personal, but more than likely, I don't have the 'Spoons.' Speaking for the sake of talking is emotionally draining for me. Intimacy for me is being able to share silence without filling it with words. To be blunt, it's also possible that communicating to you brings nothing of value to me right now, and I need to prioritize my wellbeing, safety, and future survival. Not to sound cold, but I am running my life like a business, and draining interactions are a liability. Thanks for reading and taking the time to understand where I am coming from better.**
