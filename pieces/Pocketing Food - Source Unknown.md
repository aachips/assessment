[Unusual eating behaviors may be a new diagnostic indicator for autism -- ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190709141255.htm)

Research completed in early 2019 shows that extreme eating habits could be a sign of autism in children, and 70% of autistic children have atypical eating behaviors such as hypersensitivity to food textures and colors and pocketing food.

Recently JJ has begun to pocket food in her mouth, and she just holds it there without chewing and without spitting it out. It's gotten to the point where most of her meal times are ending with me shoveling food out of her mouth with my fingers. Until a few days ago I had no idea what pocketing food was or how to go about dealing it.

I did some research so I'm here to share it with you! Pocketing food is when a child holds onto food in their mouth without swallowing. Most often kids will pocket food in their cheeks or in front of their gums.

There's many reasons as to why a child is pocketing food and sometimes there is more than one reason.

The most common reason is sensory processing. This can be a sensitivity to the taste, the texture, the temperature, color, and even the lack of feeling. They could enjoy pocketing food because of the pressure it puts on their cheeks/teeth/gums.

In contrast to sensory issues some children lack oral motor skills or regress in oral motor skills. Oral motor skills controls the strength and movements of your tongue, lips, teeth, and jaw.

Other times children begin to pocket food when it hurts to swallow. You'll see this in some kids with sore throats, chronic reflux, swollen tonsils and adenoids. In some instances this can further create a fear of swallowing which can become habitual.

We haven't figured out the reason yet as to why Julianne has started pocketing food but I think it's safe to assume it's sensory processing related.

If your child is pocketing food set up an appointment with their pediatrician and get them help sooner rather than later!
