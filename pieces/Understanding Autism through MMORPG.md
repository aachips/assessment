**A helpful metaphor for autism and regulation

Ever feel overwhelmed by life's challenges? Imagine yourself as a video game character! In this post, we'll explore how being "well-regulated" is like having the perfect gear and strategy to conquer anything life throws your way. Let's dive in and see how to become a prepared player in the game of life!
  
**The Prepared Player:**

Imagine a video game player who's ready to tackle a tough challenge. They've accepted a quest that rewards them with points, items, and gold.

This player is well-equipped. They have strong armor and weapons that perfectly suit their character. They've used special items to boost their abilities and have a helpful companion by their side. Their backpack is stocked with healing potions, extra supplies, and an emergency escape tool. They've studied the enemy's tactics and are prepared to dodge attacks. They even have a lucky charm to increase their chances of winning valuable rewards.

**The Moderately Prepared Player:**

Another player is just playing for fun, not on a specific quest. Their gear is okay, but not the best. They don't have any special items to enhance their abilities and only have basic supplies. Their companion might be helpful, but it's unreliable. They might try to fight tougher enemies, but they risk getting hurt because they're not fully prepared.

**The Unprepared Player:**

This player is a mess. They're wearing mismatched armor that slows them down, and they lack essential supplies. They're going into a difficult situation with the wrong tools and no escape plan.

**The Well-Regulated Person:**

Now, let's translate this to real life. A well-regulated person takes care of themselves. They're well-rested, fed, and hydrated. They take any medications they need and keep their phone charged, just like having the right tools in a game.

Their environment is organized and comfortable, creating a calm atmosphere. They have healthy relationships and are free from burdens like unresolved conflicts. They dress appropriately for the weather and feel good in their clothes. They manage their finances and have enough to cover necessities and emergencies.

They have a daily routine that keeps them on track with their goals and responsibilities. They take care of any maintenance needs and keep things running smoothly.

This well-regulated person understands their emotions and can manage them effectively. They're not a danger to themselves or others. They stay organized with to-do lists and have a support network for when things get tough.

**The Takeaway:**

Just like a prepared player conquers challenges in a game, a well-regulated person tackles life's challenges with confidence. They have the tools and resources they need to succeed, anticipate problems, and have backup plans. By taking care of themselves, they're empowered to face life's adventures head-on.
