Very complex. Not well understood yet. Not easy to explain. First definition is a set of processes to manage, control, and regulate thoughts and actions.

Second definition. Allows a person to connect past experiences and working memory to present situations and actions at the moment. 

Neither gives much to work with. Examples: Planning, working memory, attention, problem-solving, verbal reasoning, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and initiation of actions affects a person's ability to ID task or problems to organize and prioritize, Break task into smaller steps, stay on task, focus through steps, to complete homework. Power to self-monitor, figure out what is going wrong. In some way, people with ED impairment struggle with open-ended questiosn, and open-ended tasks, especially when there is not enough instruction or thorough education. You are likely to get the best results by saying precisely what you want. Lots of detail, if possible, step by step. For example, cleaning the kitchen or getting a job. Wander in being overwhelmed by all actions and unable to break down or very difficult to do so.  

Executive dysfunction spiral - frustration and panic, knowing what you want to do, unable to get the brain to cooperate and organize to do a thing. 

  

The outside comes off as lazy, defiant, poor work ethic, procrastination, and executive disfunctio, two very different things. Procrastination is you can do what you need to do and remember that you need to do it. If you sat down, you’d be able to break into steps, complete steps, the transition between steps, and complete the thing. 

ED, if we can even remember what to do in the first place, it’s a matter of maybe not being able to transition to what we are doing now. Maybe tasks need to be broken down, and we were incapable of doing that. We can have a lot of anxiety & stress because we know how we need to do it even if we want to do it, but are unable to get there, like running up against a wall in our brain, stuck in place. Very tricky to pinpoint exactly what is what. What brain weird thing is going on—ED has the same similarities with a sensory processing disorder. We become overwhelmed and may experience the same frustration ‘stuck in place’ feeling. Inability to task switch, ID problems & transition & leave situation causing overwhelm. This comes with learning disabilities that look like ED. Every autist will have issues with EF sometime in their life. Explaining living with ED affects every part of life. We are dealing with it almost daily. Impact by stress, sleep, sick, and tiredness can affect. It can be better on different days of the week. People will report most problems with schoolwork or job. The School system built around neurotypical majority doesn’t even accommodate them well. Does terrible with autistic children with organizational dysfunction issues. By adulthood need accommodation in certain areas to do a good job; generally, places are unwilling to accommodate the disability. A child with ED probably seems disorganized, may have a messy desk and backpack, maybe lose assignments, or forgetting they have assignments. Forgetting to turn in is not unusual to have patchy performance in school; one may do well one day in the organization and not the next—brain, stress factors, every one different. If you provide agenda to write assignments in, not unusual to forget to write in or lose it; the best you can do is ask them what you think will help. We are more aware of our abilities.
