# Autism & Friendships
I made a decision that I don't really want friends at this point in my life. But I think it's a big trap to think about it in terms of purity, 'true' friends. The mindset that the right people will be very loyal and that taking advantage of someone is always a deliberate move. More important than 'finding true friends' is practicing boundaries and terms of connection. 'I am not going to lend money to anyone. ' 'I am not going to engage with sex with someone I don't know very well.' While you may decide to not feel constraints of social friendship etiquette and mannerisms, relationships are something where you get out of it what you put in. Unfortunately, no one owes you unconditional love and royalty. And Autistic people are not immune from being exploitative, from being bad friends, or acting in poor conduct which repels others.

# Conversation Training
Conversation training is really helpful of a service for many people. It helps us be better connected to others. Adults that are seeking this should be able to find services that are helpful for (social rehabilitation?) Every state (United States speaking) has Vocational Rehabilitation as a Federally mandated agency, but I have not found similar services for coaching social skills. The only ethical issue I see is when it is for kids, and those kids may be displaying distress attempting verbal communication. When that is the case, it is good to seek out Augmented Communication tools (AAC). AAC is also my initials, and I make some AAC tools. There are high tech, low tech, and no tech forms of AAC. As a whole I think a lot of these tools are marketed towards small children, and for adults that benefit from these tools, they can be kind of patronizing tools. These types of tools can do the help that these studies speak of in diversities of nonverbal individuals. I like looking for AAC Communication Tools on Etsy, there's a lot of really good ones that come up from independent manufacturers. There are even ones that assist consenting adults in their intimate lives. Even if you have NEVER thought of yourself as having a nonverbal orientation, you may know someone who would benefit from tools like these, and they make great gifts.

Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yoruself out there. Keeping money requires the opposite of that risk, humility, and fear that what you've made can be taken away from you just as easy.

# Videos and Subtitles
Subtitles are helpful for Hard of Hearing & viewers with Sensory Processing issues. For me, it is beneficial for information retention. At :20, the audio quality dips. It is audible if everything around me is hushed and I can put my ear up to the speaker. I have done video transcriptions like that professionally and am willing to do some for extra credit. One or two weekends are coming up, I plan to be camping, and I may need an extra day to take non-digital work and transcribe it to proper assignment format. I can also rush to complete assignments before those trips, but generally, doing that is a detriment to my learning process and the quality of my work. I will do my best to comply with every assignment and reference subject matter while taking a couple of creative liberties associated with my established career goal, improving digital access to many of these services. It's terrific to meet you face to face; I will also send an email in case Youtube comments aren't checked. I am really excited to start classes and give my best.

# Discussion Responses



Hi I'm April. I don't really like being referred to, or talking about where I am from. Right now in my life I like blending into the background and being an agent behind the scenes. Even though I am new to Human Services, I consider myself a relevant expert in Behavioral Psychology and Social Work. I have a Psychology Degree. I have lived experience receiving and linking services. Not degree seeking, but if I was, it would be "Behavioral Technology." Everywhere I turn in the Behavioral, Mental Health, and Disability System there is desperate need for Tech assistance. It may look like overextended case loads of clients at an agency, or IT help with setting up online classes as a Professor. Here is a list of ways I am using my background right now, to get a better understanding:

-I am learning how individuals with various disabilities and financial barriers access the internet. This has a lot to do with Web Accessibility and Assistive Technologies. My other class right now is WEB 115 Web Development. ARIA, or Accessible Rich Internet Applications, describe native features on newer web browsers, like Screen Readers, Keyboard Navigation, Automated Subtitles, Text-Only Browser Settings, etc. I'd like to make low bandwidth users around the world a priority for accessibility by making libraries of the internet available offline through Markdown Exporting. 

-I am exploring ways to expand Chat systems as a viable communication tool for peer support specialists, agencies, and protective services. A pet peeve of mine is how restrictive and limited crisis lines are, and how emergencies are not the same thing as crises. I am a big proponent for more chat based service lines.

-I have been petitioning Health and Human Services to make Peer Support Specialist Certifications more accessible to disabled prospects by having self-paced virtual trainings accredited in North Carolina. As of now there are barriers in the field to getting accredited that push out many who lack physical abilities and transportation from providing or receiving Peer Support Care. 

-I am using classes in related subjects as fodder for writing content to publish at a later time. So on essays in this class, I may write a non-APA version, and then convert it into APA format. I'd like to have a library website repository of helpful resources that aren't easily found relating to Behavioral Health and supporting Adults with Disabilities. 

-I have made the skeleton of a non-diagnostic assessment tool for adults on the autism / adhd spectrum that covers six areas of day to day functioning: Body & 'Me', Interact, Occupational, Relational, Independent Living, and Play. There are 183 measures which answers range from Hypo- to Hyper-. It's loosely based on the RAADS-R Self-Assessment tool which has a 97% accuracy and validity diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder, and I'd argue the one I have been making for 2+ years has a wider and more comprehensive grasp of daily challenges faced by adults. 

-I have worked with LGBT Refugees in East Africa over lockdown through talking on Messenger and coordinating large donations. We have sent over 10,000$ (1,200$ of my own funds) as direct donations to individuals facing vicious persecution in Kenya and Uganda in the Kakuma Refugee Camp to buy bulk resources, and build protective fences around housing compounds as a protection from violence. Fencing and Protective Housing is a Human Right. I have written a 35 page report on protective fencing as a human right in regards to gay refugees in Kenya, mapping out a Grant Proposal to Mastercard for a 10,000,000$ experimental fund with no payback requirements.

-In my undergraduate years, I focused on identifying barriers in Science Communication to the public, especially around issues around Climate Change. Generally when I write, I prefer to use simple, and direct language, that isn't academically inaccessible for a layperson.  

-I have a Mentee in another state who is an ongoing victim of extreme abuse, neglect, and exploitation. We have been working for months to get them organized to get legal assistance and report their case. It is under investigation by their relevant state agencies now. Most of this process has been teaching them tech skills so they can go about this process safely, and engaging over Chat communication. I can't share that much more, but there are similar cases in the news (Warning of Disturbing Content, search at your own discretion: Turpin Family in California, Lacey Fletcher in Louisiana, Gypsy Rose Blanchard in Wisconsin)

Despite all of this, I am chronically unemployed and in need of supported employment and stable income. I have a very difficult time with the social requirements of in person work and am in school to find a way I can get paid to do the computer work I am already doing. If you read this far, Thank you. 

## Personal Experience Reporting Dangerous Home Environment
I want to answer this with a personal experience and lesson of a Peer I have been working with the past several months. I am involved in a case regarding a Vulnerable Adult facing extreme Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation in Florida. It is a really harrowing situation, and I don't want to get into details, both because of confidentiality, and respecting others temperaments and traumas towards these types of situations. It is important for my mental wellbeing to debrief about aspects of this situation. The facts that I will share about this are:

-The victim is a young adult with a wide range of developmental and acquired disabilities who is being defrauded medically by their adoptive parent.
-The victim has speech and communication issues. Some of these are because English is not their first language. Part of this is because over years of abuse, nothing they say wins, so they learn to be quiet in any level of stress ("Situational Mutism"). 
-Their medical appointments are dominated by their adoptive parent, who holds a enduring Power of Attorney over them which they signed under duress when they turned 18. The victim claims it is constantly abused and that he suffers for it.

This situation has been reported to the relevant Adult Protective Services agency in their state and is under active investigation. Because he had the capacity to speak for himself and advocate for his best interests, we took a few months to help him get organized, safe, and informed about reporting. With the passage of Title XX of the Social Security Act in 1974, Adult Protective Services was mandated as an agency in every state. Vulnerable Adults between the ages of 18 and 59 are protected by Safeguarding laws in every state of the US. These are most often individuals with pervasive disabilities that limit ability and capacity to advocate for self and have normal functioning day to day. While the agencies and rules vary state to state, one of the common themes is that once a report is filed, the agency has to go and do a home visit within 24 business hours. This was a very daunting and scary obstacle for the individual, however, this process makes sense.

## When there are Issues of Capacity..
A Power of Attorney can be a very helpful tool for someone who does not have the capacity to make decisions on their own behalf. However, strangers assume this person has no ability to communicate because they freeze up in appointments and in public. We talk online all the time, and they are perfectly capable of communication by text and email, negotiating on their own behalf, and fighting for their best interests when it is safe to do so. A stranger's first impression is, this person is nonverbal and disabled, and their parent has to speak for them. The reality is that they are essentially a human captive who is threatened from speaking out of turn and discouraged from speaking in general so they are easier to take advantage of. 

## Overcoming Assumptions and Implicit Biases
Making assumptions about a client, without understanding their daily environments, their histories of bereavement, and underlying conditions, is dangerous. As a Human Services Professional, if assumptions must be made, it is important to err on the side of the least dangerous assumptions. You really cannot fully understand someones experience through a Case File. 

## Investigating Abuse, Neglect, Exploitation, and Fraud
As an Investigating party, there is so much context that is important to figure out as soon as possible in these cases, that can only be found out by doing a home visit. They need to verify who lives there, that they can access the home, that they can reach the parties face to face. Investigating Parties can also observe for cues in and outside the home such as fire hazards, excrement on the floors, responses of parties to surprise visit, and many other bits of information. In understanding what is happening, a home visit is foundational and necessary to begin the entire Investigation process. 

"If you don’t visit the client’s home, you may never discover problems that have gone unvoiced."

## Reports of Self-Neglect
Roughly 2/3 of the reports received by these agencies are about Adult Self-Neglect, and cooperation is purely voluntary. All of the evidence suggests that you will learn a tremendous amount about a client by conducting a home visit. Many Human Services, such as Case Management, don't involve Home Visits at all. But if Abuse, Neglect, Exploitation, or Fraud is suspected, home visits, and the foundation of knowing the home environment, is a first line of defense.

## Client Environments when Working with Homeless Individuals
There are a tremendous amount of barriers, personal and structural, that come up with unhoused persons. There are a tremendous amount of assumptions and implicit biases that come up working with homeless individuals. Many Human Services Providers are Culturally incompetent when it comes to issues of Homelessness. Even if a Client does not have housing, they have an environment that they interact and exist in on a day to day basis. There are hostile and friendly environments. There are differences between rural and urban homelessness. Resources may be available, but transportation may not. Paid monthly bus passes may be available, but patrons can be declined from entering the bus if they have no shirt or shoes, or if they have a non-service pet with them. On top of understanding the day to day barriers a homeless client faces, keeping an updated list of local resources, such as clothing closets, public bathrooms, truck stops and gyms with showers, food pantries and free meal programs, section 8 approved housing, and other specialized agencies is a great asset for helping the homeless. Sometimes, being able to meet with these clients in their own stomping grounds, can be tremendously helpful for both parties.
