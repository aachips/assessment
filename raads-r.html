        <p><a href="">RAADS–R | Embrace Autism (embrace-autism.com)</a></p>

        <p>“The Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R) is a self-report questionnaire designed to identify adult autistics who 'escape diagnosis' due to a subclinical level presentation.”</p>

        <p>This self-assessment tool is for adults (16+ and above the ten percentile threshold [80] for IQ). There are eighty scored questions with four possible answers (True as an adult, True as a kid, not True for me, True all my life) that encompass Sensory-Motor, Social Deficits, and Circumscribed Interests. The tool was published first in 2008 and is regularly updated. There is a very high validity and reliability measure for this test, detecting a covert diagnosis within a 3% margin of error. <a href="">Here is overview and critique are by Dr. Natalie Engelbrecht, a Psychotherapist, and Naturopathic Doctor.</a></p> 

        <h2>Why am I interested in this subject matter?</h2> 
        <p>I have been interested in assessment resources for adult autistics. There is a steep drop-off in professional support, studies, and resources for individuals with pervasive developmental disorders once they become adults.[1] Often these adults fall through various cracks and are destined to live in poverty with a trail of broken relationships.[2] The average life expectancy for these individuals is staggeringly low.[3] The average age of autistic boys diagnosed is 3, while for girls, it is 25.[4] There are many reasons for this, including but not limited to external vs. internalized display of symptoms, gendered social expectations, biases, and assumptions in studies on autism being done exclusively on young white boys. The average cost of an adult assessment is 1,000$, not covered by insurance, and a huge barrier for many.[5] For low-income reviews, the waiting list averages 2.5 years. [6]</p>

        <h2>My personal experience</h2>
        <p>When I received a waitlist assessment in 2019, the clinician was in their 80s and used methods for school children to assess academic skillsets. I haven’t been in grade school for over a decade. Self-Diagnosis is common, but the tools are not very good even then. RAADS-R is one of the better self-diagnostic tools for adults, and there are still shortcomings and implicit negative biases. Besides the flaws in the testing design, these tools aren’t designed optimally for easy use and access. There aren’t many Designers in Mental Health, and it shows. The whole field needs a new look. There aren’t any good digital design techniques on this site. I would classify it as a scholarly critique and overview of this testing method. I will offer a list of what could improve the Usability and Access of the site with Digital Media Elements.</p> 

        <p>There may be a personal conflict of interest, as for the past two years, I have been drafting the Apple Chip Model of Autism Assessment Tool. It’s very similar to what this site does: take the known lexicon of clinical concepts, designate questions to assess if this is a problem in the individual's life, and score accordingly. I used inspiration from the Color Chapter to color code the five sections in my Assessment Tool. I plan to learn basic HTML and CSS to make a working model of this tool. This will not be a completely free service. However, it will not be thousands of dollars either. My other goal is to design and develop a color-coded deck of 120 Spicy Ranch Autism Cards, with each of these clinical concepts illustrated and defined in a guidebook. There will be a scholarship program to fund professional behavior analysis and write-up.</p>

        <h3>Communication with a Mental Health Professional</h3>
        <p>A developer tool I learned about this week is Twilio. Twilio is a communication API service that can generate a phone number, email for bulk messages, chatbox for various customer service needs. Their biggest known client is AirBnB, which operates worldwide’s timezones, and needs to be responsive to customers and host messages every minute of the day. They have a flash game called TwilioQuest, which teaches Python programming in a fun and interactive way. Earlier in this class, I talked about the benefits of having live chat help with filling out applications for an assignment. I had no idea how someone would install a Chat Box feature on their software at that time. Twilio makes this relatively simple for a developer. I also believe for something such as an Autism self-assessment of any kind, it may be beneficial to ask questions in live time with a clinician. If not in a live chat, then on a non-traceable email attached to a listserv of practicing mental health providers competent in these assessments.</p>

        <h3>Wiki Style Mini Encyclopedia of Mental Health</h3>
        <p>By this point, Wikipedia is a household internet name, well known by many online users. It is a massive online encyclopedia available to anyone for free to edit. There are dozens of Wiki-style websites on all sorts of broader topics. There was a Wiki site about Steal This Book by Abbie Hoffman for many years. The site shared living tactics for free and without being controlled by money in every major US city. There is Fandom, which has all sorts of Wikis related to different movie and gaming fandoms. There is a Psychology WIki listed on Fandom.com. Having links to related clinical terms is a great way not to alienate most users by using big words.</p>

        <h3>Audio Narration by Section</h3>
        <p>There are many reasons why reading is more challenging or impossible for some users. There are blind users, illiterate users, dyslexic users, and all of those comorbid challenges are likely to be found by people accessing an Autism or ADHD self-assessment. Having a button by each section to narrate improves the accessibility of the site. This is also a challenge made easier by having the option to Appoint a Helper on another computer. Screen sharing software can be beneficial for this.</p>

        <h2>Request Professional Write Up of Results</h2>
        <p>Someone seeking self-assessment for a Developmental Disability is likely to be struggling in one or more areas of their life. Maybe they can’t get or keep a job. Perhaps they can’t live with other people, or alone, or maintain the responsibilities of living in a house. Maybe they feel like they drive friendships and other relations away and want to identify their specific social deficits. Giving a Yes or No result can be incredibly unhelpful. And if you have to decipher question values, math, and scoring metrics to figure that out, your assessment tool will not be beneficial. Being able to pay fifty bucks to have a professional read your test results, and write a short synopsis of what you are looking for, write a document that you can include in a housing application, with a resume, or an about me to give to new prospect friends, would help a lot of people. This can also include a post-assessment form made from Google Forms and a short live interview.</p> 
        
        <h3>Instructional Tutorial Videos</h3>
        <p>It knows what to expect from the beginning, with a short breakdown video of how the self-assessment tool works to retain more people visiting the site. It will make the process and its workings simple.</p>
