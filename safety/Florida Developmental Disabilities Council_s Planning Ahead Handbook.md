We wanted to make everyone aware of a free resource for parents, family members, and guardians of adult children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) in Florida. It’s the [Planning Ahead handbook](https://fddc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Planning-Ahead_-2017.pdf), created by the [Florida Developmental Disabilities Council (FDDC)](https://www.fddc.org/). It’s a helpful tool for planning for all stages of a person’s life who has an IDD.

### **What’s In the Planning Ahead Handbook?**

The Planning Ahead handbook is an in-depth guide that helps you think through all the areas you need to plan for if you’re the parent or guardian of an individual with an IDD in Florida. It addresses the importance of self-determination and inclusion for the beneficiary of your planning, and how to take a person-centered approach.

It then walks you through a person’s various life stages and common life-changing events, covering the sort of things you need to plan for. There are also chapters and sections on topics like changing caregivers; effective advocacy and self-advocacy; finding appropriate federal, state, and local resources for improving the quality of life of a person with an IDD; [vocational rehabilitation services in Florida](https://noahsarkflorida.org/introduction-to-vocational-rehabilitation-services-in-florida/); exploring employment and volunteer opportunities; choosing the right housing option; disaster preparedness; healthcare; legal, financial, and medical decision-making and protections; estate planning; and more.

Then, the Planning Ahead handbook has an extensive list of resources for parents and guardians of people with an IDD in Florida. There are also a number of important and helpful forms you can print out and complete.
