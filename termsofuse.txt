
        This assessment tool is a project I’ve been building for three years. It is a non-diagnostic questionnaire for adults who suspect or know they are on the ADHD / Autism Spectrum. If you wish to download the most current PDF draft you can do so here.


        This test can be completed by a second-party on someone close to them, however, it must be stressed, this is not diagnostic, and it is good etiquette to get that person’s consent before evaluating their behaviors. 
        
        The closest model to this assessment is the RAADS-R (Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised), but is it’s own independent entity.
        
        If you are interested in taking this assessment, I humbly ask for you to provide me your contact details. This is to track metrics, and I have no intention to email you as of now, but may send periodic greetings and updates about this and related projects.

        If answer to a question represents a tangible challenge or ongoing, persistent problem in the person’s life, score +1 in the respective section. There is a clinical phenomenon name behind every question. This is not diagnostic, but meant to start a conversation and make support structures easier to determine.
